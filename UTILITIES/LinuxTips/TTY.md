## When to use TTY
It should come in handy in case the graphical desktop environment freezes. In some cases, reinstalling the desktop environment from the TTY helps resolve the program.

Or, you can also choose to carry out tasks in TTY like updating the Linux system and similar, where you do not want visual issues to interrupt your process.

Worst-case scenario, you can go to the TTY and reboot the computer if your graphical user interface is unresponsive.
