# Concept
## Working Directory
Referring to your files that have been _saved_, but not staged or committed yet.
## Index
The index is the “staging area” in your Git workflow.
Inside every `.git` folder, there is a special file called `index`. This is the file that tracks the files that are staged when you perform a Git add
## Commit History
Kinda explain itself

# git reset

## git reset --soft
Delete commit history
Re-adds the changes as staged, ready to be committed again.

# git checkout
Delete changes in working directory
