Based on the search results and the question, here are the typical cases where we need to use `extern "C"` when programming Windows applications with C++:



## 1. When creating functions that will be part of the Windows API:

Using `extern "C"` ensures that function names remain unchanged, allowing them to be properly linked with other components 
Điển hình: `DllMain`




## 2. When including C headers in C++ code:

We often need to wrap `#include` statements for non-standard C headers in C++ using `extern "C"` [1]. This prevents name mangling for functions declared in those headers.

Example:
```cpp
extern "C" {
    #include <windows.h>
}
```

4. When creating wrapper functions for C++ functions:

If we want C code to call overloaded C++ functions, we need to create wrapper functions declared with `extern "C"` [1].

Example:
```cpp
extern "C" int foo_i(int i) { return foo(i); }
extern "C" double foo_d(double d) { return foo(d); }
```

5. When exporting functions from DLLs:

Using `extern "C"` ensures that exported functions have non-mangled names [1].

Example (in a .def file):
```
EXPORTS
    MyFunction @1
```

6. When interfacing with third-party C libraries:

If we're using external C libraries in our C++ application, we may need to use `extern "C"` to declare functions from those libraries [1].

In summary, `extern "C"` is primarily used to prevent name mangling and ensure proper linkage between C and C++ code, especially when interfacing with external libraries or creating functions that need to be callable from both C and C++. In Windows programming with C++, it's often used when dealing with the Windows API or third-party C libraries.
