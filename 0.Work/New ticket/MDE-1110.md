# Outline
the issue with the message not changing to the right status when receiving a disable status from fsd_feature_config_property via ServiceProxy :

1. In FSDFeature.cpp, the status change is handled in the registerStatusFSD() function, but it only updates the status_ member variable and emits a fsdStatusChange signal. There's no direct connection between this status change and the message UI.

2. The MainMessage.qml file doesn't appear to have any direct binding or handler for the FSD feature's enabled/disabled state. It's focused on displaying file scanning information rather than the overall feature status.

3. The FSDMessage.cpp file, which handles the communication between the backend and the message UI, doesn't seem to register for or handle the fsd_feature_config_property status changes.


To resolve this, you would need to:

1. Implement a mechanism in FSDFeature.cpp to send `fsdDisable` signal .
2. Update FSDMessage.cpp to listen  to `fsdDisable` 
3. Modify MainMessage.qml to react to the feature's enabled/disabled state, possibly by adding a new property or signal handler.

These changes would ensure that the message UI reflects the correct status when the FSD feature is disabled through the fsd_feature_config_property.
# Implement
In FSDFeature.cpp, add a new signal and emit it when the status changes:

```cpp
// In the FSDFeaturePrv class declare signal
signals:
    void fsdDisable(bool enabled);

// In the lambda function for fsd_feature_config_property::status
if (attr->get_disabled_by_user()) {
    status_ = OWCFSDState::Disabled;
} else {
    status_ = OWCFSDState::Enabled;
}
emit fsdDisable();
```


2. In FSDMessage.cpp, register for this new signal and update the UI:

```cpp
// In the FSDMessagePrv::init() function
connect(FSDFeature::instance(), &FSDFeature::fsdDisable,
        this, &FSDMessagePrv::onFsdDisable);
```

declare slot to `FSDMessagePrv`
```cpp
void FSDMessagePrv::onFsdDisable(bool enabled) {
    //need to know what to do here
    OAFSHandle_->pushNotification();
}
```



3. In AccessedFileScanningImpl.h, declare `updateFeatureStatus` and implement it

```cpp
public slots:
    void updateFeatureStatus(bool enabled);
```

implement the new method:

```cpp
void AccessedFileScanningImpl::updateFeatureStatus(bool enabled) {
    emit featureStatusChanged(enabled);
}
```

5. In MainMessage.qml, add a new property and handler:

```qml
property bool fsdDisable: true

Connections {
    target: filterdriver
    function onFsdDisable(enabled) {
        fsdEnabled = enabled;
        // Update UI elements based on the new status
        // For example, you might want to show/hide certain elements
        title.visible = fsdEnabled;
        recBG.visible = fsdEnabled;
        // ... other UI updates as needed
    }
}
```
