# Overview abstract
The `FeatureManager` class is responsible for managing the UI features in the OPSWAT Gears Client application. It interacts with the `OWCFeatureManager` class to enable or disable features based on the server configuration and account type. The `FeatureManagerDataPrv` class handles the communication with the service proxy and updates the available features based on the received status.

Overall, these files work together to manage the features in the OPSWAT Gears Client application, both on the backend and the user interface level. The `OWCFeatureManager` class handles the backend features, while the `FeatureManager` class manages the UI features and their visibility in the application.

- Overall, the OWCFeatureManager class provides a way to manage features in a software system. 
-  Class OWCFeatureManager is derived from the FeatureManager class. `FeatureManager` class is part of a shared library or framework used by multiple projects. 
- It allows features to be installed, disabled, upgraded, and queried.


# Overview implementation

## Purpose
This class  determines which features should be enabled or disabled based on various conditions, such as configuration settings, account types, and server configurations.

## Input
The code takes input from various sources, including configuration files, registry settings, and server responses. It also interacts with other components of the application, such as the server configuration manager and the feature factory.

## Output
The primary output of this code is the list of enabled and disabled features, which is communicated to other parts of the application through an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

## method class provide

1. The `init()` function is called during the initialization phase of the application. It sets up various event handlers and connections to monitor changes in configuration settings and account types.
    
2. The `initFeature()` function is used to enable or disable specific features based on configuration settings. It connects to the observable configuration object and registers callbacks to handle changes in the configuration.
    
3. The `triggerOnOffOFTFeature()` function is a crucial part of the code. It determines whether the main user interface (OFT-GUI) should be enabled or disabled based on various conditions, such as the account type, server configuration, and the availability of other features.
    
4. The `registerNewFeatureName()` and `deregisterFeatureName()` functions are used to manage the list of available features. They add or remove feature names from a sorted list, which is later communicated to other parts of the application through the IPC mechanism.
    
5. The `installMissingFeatures()` function is responsible for installing any missing features. It launches an installer process and monitors its progress, retrying the installation if necessary.
    
6. The `onFeatureInstallationFinished()` function is called when a feature has been successfully installed. It updates the feature name list and triggers the `triggerOnOffOFTFeature()` function to ensure that the user interface is updated accordingly.
