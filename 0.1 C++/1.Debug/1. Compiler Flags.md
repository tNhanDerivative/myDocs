https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html

`-Wall` : This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. 
# Debug 
`Symbol`: is variable names, function names, filesname ...
 On Windows, the debugging information is normally stored in a separate file, a .pdb. A piece of debug data from that file about a function or a variable in your program is called a symbol.
 
`-g` add debugging symbols to our compiled code
`-o` no optimization
