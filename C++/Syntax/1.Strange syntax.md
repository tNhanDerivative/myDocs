# Template in C++

# Type and return
```cpp
template<typename Type, typename CTPR>

struct Strongly_Type{
    auto value()const { return m_value;}

    protected:
    Type m_value;

}
```
The `const` qualifier after the parentheses indicates that the function is a const member function, which means it can be called on const objects of the class but cannot modify any non-static data members of the class.


# Line continuation
This is particularly useful when writing long statements or expressions that would otherwise exceed the line length limit. Here's an example:
```cpp
std::cout << "This is a very long string that we want to split across \
multiple lines for readability.";
```
Without the backslash, the compiler would treat the string as ending at the end of the first line, resulting in a syntax error. With the backslash, the compiler understands that the string continues onto the next line

# Initializer List

[explain geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-do-we-use-initializer-list-in-c/)

```cpp
class Point {
private:
    int x,y;
public:

    Point(int i = 0, int j = 0):x(i), y(j) {}
    
};


```

# shorthand for if else

```cpp
int sign = (number > 0) ? 1 : 0;
// equal to
if (number > 0) sign = 1;
else sign = 0; 

```

```cpp
bool is_constructed(std::size_t idx)
{
	return is_valid(idx) ? 
		(get_object.is_active()) : false;
```
