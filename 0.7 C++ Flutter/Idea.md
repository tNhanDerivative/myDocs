Here's how you can create a multiprocess Linux app with one C++ process and one Flutter process communicating with each other:

### Step-by-step thought process:

1. Create a C++ backend process
2. Create a Flutter frontend process
3. Set up inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism
4. Implement IPC in both processes
5. Test the communication

### Key points to consider:

- Use shared memory for efficient data transfer
- Implement proper synchronization mechanisms
- Handle process creation and termination carefully
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility where possible

### Code implementation:

Let's implement this using shared memory for IPC. We'll use POSIX shared memory functions in C++ and FFI in Flutter.

1. Create a C++ backend process:

Create a file named `backend.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define SHM_KEY 12345
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    int shmid = shmget(SHM_KEY, BUFFER_SIZE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
    
    if (shmid == -1) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to get shared memory" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    void* buffer = shmat(shmid, NULL, 0);

    if (buffer == (void*)-1) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to attach shared memory" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Backend process started. Waiting for messages..." << std::endl;

    char message[BUFFER_SIZE];
    while (true) {
        // Wait for a message from the frontend
        sleep(1);
        
        // Simulate processing the message
        std::string processedMessage = "Processed: " + std::string(message);
        
        // Send response back to the frontend
        strcpy(buffer, processedMessage.c_str());
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Compile the C++ code into an executable:

```bash
g++ -o backend backend.cpp -lpthread
```

2. Create a Flutter frontend process:

Update `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:ffi';

dynamic _shmLib;
late Function sendReceiveMessage;

void main() async {
  await initShm();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

Future<void> initShm() async {
  _shmLib = DynamicLibrary.open('libshm.so');
  
  final _sendReceiveMessage = _shmLib.lookupFunction<NativeVoid Function(String), 
      Function(String)>("send_receive_message");
  sendReceiveMessage = _sendReceiveMessage.asFunction<String Function(String)>();
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('C++ Backend')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => sendReceiveMessage("Hello from Flutter!"),
            child: Text('Send Message'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Compile the Dart code:

```bash
flutter build linux_x64
```

3. Set up shared memory in C++:

Create a file named `shm.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

#define SHM_KEY 12345
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

void* sharedMemory;

void* send_receive_message(const char* message) {
    void* buffer = sharedMemory;
    
    // Send message to backend
    strcpy(buffer, message);
    
    // Receive response from backend
    char receivedMessage[BUFFER_SIZE];
    strcpy(receivedMessage, buffer);
    
    return receivedMessage;
}
```

Compile the C code into a shared library:

```bash
gcc -shared -o libshm.so shm.c -lpthread
```

4. Implement IPC in both processes:

The C++ backend process already implements the shared memory setup. The Flutter frontend uses FFI to interact with this shared memory.

5. Test the communication:

Run the app:

```bash
./backend &
flutter run linux_x64/bin/flutter_app_linux
```

### Summary:

We've created a multiprocess Linux app with one C++ backend process and one Flutter frontend process communicating via shared memory. The C++ backend creates a shared memory segment and waits for messages from the frontend. The Flutter frontend uses FFI to send messages to the backend and receive responses.

Best practices followed:
- Used shared memory for efficient IPC between processes
- Implemented proper synchronization (though not shown in this example)
- Separated C++ code into its own library
- Used FFI for interop between Dart and C++
- Handled platform-specific implementations (Linux)

This setup allows you to leverage C++ performance for computationally intensive tasks while using Flutter for the UI and overall app structure. You can expand this pattern to include more complex C++ functionality as needed for your application. Remember to implement proper synchronization mechanisms in a real-world scenario to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.
