## Introduction to Direct3D

- **Direct3D**Â is a graphics application programming interface (API) that allows for the creation of 3D graphics in applications, particularly games.
- The first step in using Direct3D is to create a window, as a window is essential for rendering graphics.
- Windows are fundamental in Windows programming; everything is treated as a window.

## Creating a Window

- To create a Direct3D device, you need to set up a window using the Windows 32 WinAPI.
- **Key Components**:
    - **Windows Class**: This defines the properties of a window, such as its style and behavior.
    - **Registration**: You must register a Windows class before creating a window instance.
### Steps to Create a Window

1. **Register a Windows Class**:
    - This involves calling a function that registers the class on the Windows side.
    - It's important to note that these classes are not C++ classes; they do not have constructors or destructors.
2. **Create an Instance of the Class**:
    - After registration, you can create one or more instances of that class, which will result in actual windows being displayed on the screen.
