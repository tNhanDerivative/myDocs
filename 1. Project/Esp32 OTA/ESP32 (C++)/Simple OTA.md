```Cpp
static SimpleOTA *instance = NULL;

SimpleOTA::SimpleOTA() {
  t1 = 0;
  t2 = 0;
  currentState = NONE;
  instance = this;
}
```

The code you provided is a constructor for a class called SimpleOTA. Here is a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. The constructor is defined with the name `SimpleOTA::SimpleOTA()`.
2. Inside the constructor, there are four lines of code that initialize member variables of the class:
3.  `instance = this;` initializes the variable `instance` with the value of the current object (`this`) just like self in python

### Scope resolution operator ::
#Cplusplus/ScopeResolutuion/Example

In this case: The double colon operator is used to access static members of a class. It allows you to access static variables or call static functions without an instance of the class. For example, `ClassName::staticMember` refers to a static member of the class `ClassName`
