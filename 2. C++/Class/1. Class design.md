## Use method without instance
- You can call a class method without a class instance by declaring the method as `static`.
- This means the method belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
   static int MyMethod(int * a, int * b);
};

int MyClass::MyMethod(int * a, int * b) {
   return *a + *b;
}

int main() {
   int one = 1;
   int two = 2;
   MyClass::MyMethod(&two, &one);
   return 0;
}
```
