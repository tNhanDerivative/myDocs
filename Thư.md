I'm writing this letter on behalf of Tuan Anh Mom, first Mrs Van totally agree that Tuan Anh's action should meet consequence; 
But I also believe Tuan Anh need little bit help just a little bit and he will improve by his self. First I just want to explain how Tuan Anh act the way he act and how Tuan Anh did improved in the past, and why he deserve a little help just a little help.

His grand father working under Republic of Vietnam (the USA Bloc during part of the Cold War after the 1954 division of Vietnam), after the war his family face a lot of discrimination from the Communist government. Tuan Anh father was born handicap due to complication while giving birth with poor medical infrastructure at that time. Needless to say Tuan Anh's father hate Communism and have a dream that he will grown his kid talented then serve the great USA. Minh Phuong was always the bright one, and Tuan Anh was not, so he was extremely strict toward Tuan Anh, his life was always like moving prison to another prison.

Now giving him a bit of freedom, he started to break boundary a little bit here, a little bit there just to feel how far this boundary is, and how free he is now. 

His father doesn't let him freely do anything, his word was always fierce and harsh. His sister is not just book smart but high EQ and she also can retaliate again her dad but Tuan Anh is different he was always the sweet kid who understand how hard his dad life was in the past and he still genuinely love his father, he is tall big and his dad in a wheel chair but he never retaliate against his dad. About than 1 year ago his mom saw his behavior was strange so she secretly hire a locksmith to open his locker  and read his diary it was disorderly written in Vietnamese and English, it was quite a shock to me when his Mom show me because the English part was his suicide plan. He had already order some pill and stash in his bathroom. 
It was bad he was very depressed, he don't have energy and don't care about school which make his dad more and more angry. We finally find a way to get him up, we talk about future study abroad stay away from his dad, but his dad won't let him go abroad unless he get a serious scholarship. He changed after 1 night, we didn't expect him to improve his grade that fast, but he did, he gave his 150%.

I was watching him his whole life his action also was partly my fault. He was a target of bullying in the past because he was always the sad quiet kid and can't express himself by word. I did teach him to make himself a hard target, I taught him to retaliate hard, dirty and surprise. I didn't specifically tell him how to retaliate, but I did praise him for his creative method. I think you've already has an idea on how he retaliated against his bullies. He gain a lot of confident after that.

He's scared now, he's in shock he understood how serious the consequence is. He is facing his old life that he has been trying so hard to to get out. Me and Tuan Anh's Mom both agree Tuan Anh must own up his own action but, in his situation it's like a death sentence. Hear me out this kid is my favorite cousin because he has a pure heart truly pure heart after all he've been through he has a better heart than mine. From an educational perspective, I believe he deserve a chance even if it just let him stay to the end of this school year, let him have enough time embrace the life he should have, enough time to think how he should operate in his life from now on.

I'm Nhan, Tuan Anh's cousin I'm writing this letter on behalf of Tuan Anh's mom. First, Mrs. Van totally agrees that Tuan Anh's actions should have consequences; but I also believe that Tuan Anh needs a little bit of help, and he will improve by himself.

First, I just want to explain why Tuan Anh acts the way he does, how he has improved in the past, and why he deserves a little help. His grandfather worked under the Republic of Vietnam (the USA Bloc during part of the Cold War after the 1954 division of Vietnam). After the war, his family faced a lot of discrimination from the Communist government. Tuan Anh's father was born with a handicap due to complications during birth, worsened by poor medical infrastructure at that time. Needless to say, Tuan Anh's father hates Communism and dreams of raising his kid to be talented and serve the great USA.

Minh Phuong was always the bright one, and Tuan Anh was not, so his father was extremely strict toward Tuan Anh. His life was always like moving from one prison to another. Now, with a bit of freedom, he started to break boundaries here and there just to feel how far he can go and how free he is. His father doesn’t let him do anything freely, and his words are always fierce and harsh. His sister is not just book smart but also has high emotional intelligence, and she can retaliate against her dad. But Tuan Anh is different. He has always been the sweet kid who understands how hard his dad's life was in the past and still genuinely loves his father. He is tall and big, and his dad is in a wheelchair, but he never retaliates against his dad, which sadly seems make it worse for him

About a year ago, his mom noticed his strange behavior, so she secretly hired a locksmith to open his locker and read his diary. It was disorderly written in Vietnamese and English. It was quite a shock when his mom showed me because the English part detailed his suicide plan. He had already ordered some pills and stashed them in his bathroom. It was bad. He was very depressed. He didn't have energy and didn't care about school, which made his dad angrier and angrier. We finally found a way to motivate him. We talked about future study abroad options, staying away from his dad, but his dad wouldn't let him go abroad unless he got a serious scholarship. He changed overnight. We didn't expect him to improve his grades that fast, but he did; he gave 150%.

I have been watching him his whole life. His actions were also partly my fault. He was a target of bullying in the past because he was always the sad, quiet kid and couldn’t express himself with words. I taught him to make himself a hard target, to retaliate hard, dirty, and with surprise. I didn't specifically tell him how to retaliate, but I praised him for his creative methods. I think you already have an idea of how he retaliated against his bullies. He gained a lot of confidence after that.

He's scared now; he's in shock. He understands how serious the consequences are. He is facing his old life that he has been trying so hard to get out of. Tuan Anh's mom and I both agree that Tuan Anh must own up to his actions, but in his situation, it's like a death sentence. Hear me out: this kid is my favorite cousin because he has a truly pure heart after all he’s been through, he has a better heart than mine. From an educational perspective, I also believe he deserves a chance, even if it's just to let him stay until the end of this school year. This would give him enough time to embrace the life he should have and think about how he should operate in his life from now on.
