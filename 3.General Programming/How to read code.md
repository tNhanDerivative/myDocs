# Focus on explaining
1) The purpose of the code 
2) What inputs it takes 
3) What outputs it produces 
4) How it achieves its purpose through its structure (inheritance, patterns)
5) Important logic flows or data transformations happening. 
Use simple language a beginner could understand. 
Include enough detail to give a full picture of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too technical.  
Write the explanation assuming no prior context about the code is known. 
Do not make assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the shared code.
